<h4><strong> A big part of my life, and who I am, has been shaped by my hobbies and the various extracurriulars I have participated in. This list contains some activities I feel most passionate about. </strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li><h3>Soccer</h3></li>
	The most influential topic that describes my personality is soccer. From the age of 4, I have been exposed to the sport. I passionatly love the game, because of its simplicity, and the worldwide recognition. From the various places I have lived (4 states adn 2 countries), I have been part of many local teams, and experienced the resounding love of the world's game.
<li><h3>Art</h3></li>
    <p>Another passion, one that has been passed down generations in  my family, is art. My father and grandfather have taught me the diverse forms of it, from drawing and painting, to woodworking and model architecture. Below are some of my best pieces.   </p>

  <li>
    <h3>Taekwondo</h3></li>
	  <p>Along with soccer, another sport I have dedicated my youth to was taekwondo. In 6 years, I climbed through the ranks of white and yellow, to a first-degree black belt. During that time, I participated in many tournaments and testings. Taekwondo taught me the incredible amount of dedication and focus that is required to fulfill your dreams and ambitions. </p>
