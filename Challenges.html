<h4>All throughout my life, I have experienced many obstacles, and some of the key ones include:</h4>
<h3>Moving states and countries</h3>
	<h4>Since I was a child, moving locations has been a familiar thing for me. My family and I immigrated from India to the United States when I was just 9 months olds. We started living in Iowa for about 2 years, until we moved to New Hampshire for 1 year. We then experienced the hot summer of Texas, until coming back to Iowa for another 8 years. In the summer of 2021, my family decided to move one last time before my college preperations, to North Carolina. The main reasons for these moves were my parents' jobs, and the most difficult things were adapting to new environments, leaving close friends and making new ones.   </h4>

<h3><strong>Immigration Problems</strong></h3>
	<h4>As an immigrant from India, my father is still on an EB-1 visa, while I am a dependent. This means that I cannot work until I am 18 and have to meet many more requiremets until our green card shows up. As a visa holder, my family must travel to India once in a couple years in order to ge it stamped. However, the process is not simple, as there is a chance of rejection (that we have also experienced). After all these immigration challenges, things are finally starting to look bright as we are approaching green card status. </h4>
