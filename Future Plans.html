<p><h4>As a Junior at Apex High, I only have 2 years until college and starting a new chapter of my life. During these 2 years, I plan on taking many math and science courses to aim at achieving an engineering degree.</h4>
<h3>Interest:</h3>
<h4>As of yet I have not chosen a definte field of engineering to focus on, but based on my interests, I believe it will be in Aerospace or Software.</h4>
<h3>Preperations:</h3><h4>Preperations have already started from my part, as I have participated in multiple engineering-based activities, like camps at NC State. The classes I am taking currently also revolve around the field. </h4>
<h3>Goals:</h3><h4>Two primary goals for my career are to obtain to a high paying job, but also to feel passionate and enthusiastic about it. I know many people in my life, who only chose their respective careers because of the money, rather than the happiness and will to carry out their responsibilites. </h4>
